# accept

#include <sys/socket.h>

The accept() function shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file descriptor for that socket.

# bind

#include <functional>

Returns a function object based on fn, but with its arguments bound to args.

Calling the returned object returns the same type as fn, unless a specific return type is specified as Ret (2) (note that Ret is the only template parameter that cannot be implicitly deduced by the arguments passed to this function).

# connect
  
#include <sys/socket.h>

The connect() function shall attempt to make a connection on a socket. The function takes the following arguments:

socket
  
  - Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket. 
  
address
  
  - Points to a sockaddr structure containing the peer address. The length and format of the address depend on the address family of the socket. 
  
address_len
  
  - Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address argument.
