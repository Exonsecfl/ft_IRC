# accept

```#include <sys/socket.h>```

The accept() function shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file descriptor for that socket.

  - https://linux.die.net/man/3/accept

# bind

```#include <functional>```

Returns a function object based on fn, but with its arguments bound to args.

Calling the returned object returns the same type as fn, unless a specific return type is specified as Ret (2) (note that Ret is the only template parameter that cannot be implicitly deduced by the arguments passed to this function).

# connect

```#include <sys/socket.h>```
  
More dedicated to the client side

The connect() function shall attempt to make a connection on a socket. The function takes the following arguments:

socket
  
  - Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket. 
  
address
  
  - Points to a sockaddr structure containing the peer address. The length and format of the address depend on the address family of the socket. 
  
address_len
  
  - Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address argument.

# fcntl

``` #include <unistd.h> ```

``` #include <fcntl.h> ```

The operating characteristics of sockets can be controlled with the fcntl() call. The operations to be controlled are determined by cmd. The arg parameter is a variable with a meaning that depends on the value of the cmd parameter.

Parameter
  - Description
socket
  - The socket descriptor.
cmd
  - The command to perform.
arg
  - The data associated with cmd. 

Look at the sources as description of commands must be review.

# fstat

```#include <sys/types.h>```

```#include <sys/stat.h>```

```#include <unistd.h>```

These functions return information about a file. No permissions are required on the file itself, but-in the case of stat() and lstat() - execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories in path that lead to the file.

  -stat() stats the file pointed to by path and fills in buf.
  -lstat() is identical to stat(), except that if path is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file that it refers to.
  -fstat() is identical to stat(), except that the file to be stat-ed is specified by the file descriptor fd. 

Look at the sources to have information about the stat structure

# freeaddrinfo

```#include <sys/types.h>```
```#include <sys/socket.h>```
```#include <netdb.h>```



# getaddrinfo

# gethostbyname

# getprotobyname

# getsockname

# htonl

# htons

# inet_addr

# inet_ntoa

# listen

# lseek

# ntohl

# ntohs

# poll (ou Ã©quivalent)

# setsockopt

# send

# signal

# socket

Specifies a socket that was created with socket(), has been bound to an address with bind(), and has issued a successful call to listen().
